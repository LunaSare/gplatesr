`gplatesr` is an R package with example code showing how to use the GPlates web service to generate plate reconstructions directly from http requests. GPlates is developed by the EarthByte Group [https://www.earthbyte.org]

Soon you will be able to install the released version of gplatesr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r

Alternatively you can install it directly from github with:
