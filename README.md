gplatesr

The goal of gplatesr is to package the examples from https://github.com/bomeara/gplates_web_service_doc/tree/master/R available in  https://www.earthbyte.org/

## Installation

Soon you will be able to install the released version of gplatesr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("gplatesr")
```
Alternatively you can install it directly from github with:
``` r
devtools::install_github("LunaSare/gplatesr")
```

and follow the vignette to generate your own plate reconstruction images at any geologic point in time.
